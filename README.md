# Test MARKDOWN AUTO DOCS 1

Note: I have disabled this file's formatting with prettier in `.prettierignore` file.

<!-- MARKDOWN-AUTO-DOCS:START (CODE:src=./myfile.js) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from ./myfile.js -->
```js
console.log('file.js? - 5:15pm');
```
<!-- MARKDOWN-AUTO-DOCS:END -->

Please refer the original readme file at Readme-original.md file in this repo.
