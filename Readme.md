## Todo

- Newer files (16 Dec, 2024): `new-0.js`, `new-1.js`, `new-2.js`
- all other .js files in this repository

For all above files should render in a single file for easier reference and put the link of this in `sahilrajput03/ learn-javascript.md` file. And probably convert `learn-javascript.md` file in this manner such that all exampels are in `.js` files but are rendered inside the markdown file.

- **TRY if you can add front-matter such that text mentioned in the file and text in between the lines can act as notes after text snippets in the js file code.**
